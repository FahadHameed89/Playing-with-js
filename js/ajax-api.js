/**
 * AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
 * =============================================================================================
 * Lets us use Javascript to request information from spearate URLS
 * Make separate HTTP/HTTPS request post initial page-load.
 * We can use JS to make an AJAX request to URL endpoints to request additional data
 * You can retrive HTML, JSON, or XML. Mostly JSONs nowadays because it's really good for this type of thing. 
 * 
 * Despite AJAX referring to XML, we are usually dealing with JSON formatted data.
 * 
 * With JS, this is our best option for making external requests and getting data returned.
 * 
 * The modern way to make AJAX requests with JS is to use the built-in 'Fetch' function/feature.
